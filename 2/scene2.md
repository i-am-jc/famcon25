Eldest: 
 	I can’t believe we finally got to visit the caves! They’re sooo much more beautiful in real life. 
Youngest: 
 	And the water was sooo blue and sooo clear! 
Mom: 
 	Right?? I grew up seeing postcards and photos of the caves, but nothing compares to the real thing. 
Dad: 
 	(teasing) I bet you have your new profile photo ready Mom, don’t you? 
Mom: 
 	Once we get home, I’m uploading a whole album on Facebook! 
Middle: 	Please, not any embarrassing photos, Mom! 
 
<mark> SFX 	Dad’s phone pings with MANY NOTIFICATIONS. He takes his phone out of his pocket. </mark>
 
Dad: 
 	[Eldest], can you take over here for a minute? I need to answer this quickly.  
Eldest: 
 	(goes to him, takes the oar and starts ROWING) Another work email, Dad? 

<mark> AT RISE 	Dad goes to the BOAT BOW, occasionally stretching his phone out for reception. </mark>
 
Dad:  
 	(still looking at and typing on his phone) Yes—we’ve been talking to this big client for weeks, and now their emails are looking very promising. We have to act fast to seal the deal! 
Middle:  	(to Eldest) Dad is aaaalways working. Not a day goes by without his work phone. 
 
Dad: 
 	<mark> (looks up quickly at Middle and Eldest Child)</mark> I could say the same about you and your phone! (sighs) You’re not old enough to understand yet, but we need this money. You know I love spending time with you all, but this vacation cost a lot, we still have bills to pay, and your mom and I are saving up for you to go to high school soon. That’s why I need to work, always. 

Middle:
(sighing to themself) I thought this was a family vacation… 
 
<mark>AT RISE 	Eldest shakes their head, stops ROWING, pulls out their phone, and starts scrolling. Seeing the Eldest, Middle pulls out earphones from their pocket and listens to music.  SFX THUNDER RUMBLING in the distance.  Display "DARKENING SKY" in Main Display</mark>


Youngest:
(goes closer to Mom, holds on to her shirt) Mom, look at the dark clouds. I’m scared. 
 
Mom:
(puts arm around Youngest Child) Oh, it’s okay, (Youngest). I’m sure we’ll be fine. (looks at Dad) Dad, how far are we from the mainland? 
 
AT RISE 	Dad doesn’t respond and continues to type on his phone. Mom leaves the BOAT DECK and goes to him on the BOW. 
 
Mom:  
 	(clears her throat, louder voice) Dad? 
Dad:  	(still looking at and typing on his phone) Hmm? Oh, not too long now. The rain won’t catch us, don’t worry. 
 
SFX + LIGHTS 	THUNDER RUMBLING again, louder. LIGHTING flashes once, twice! 
LED 	Main LED: BAD WEATHER 
KPD 	BAD WEATHER (faster winds, one big wave) 
 
All: 	Woah! 
 
AT RISE 	Shocked, everyone holds on to the boat to anchor themselves. On the 
BOAT DECK, Mom holds on to Youngest. On the SIDES, Eldest falls to the 
	floor—and Middle ignores them, and returns to ROWING. On the BOW, Dad grows unsteady but continues to type on his phone and seek reception. 
 
Eldest: 
 	Ow! 
Mom: 
 	[Eldest], are you okay? [Middle], help him out, please. 
Eldest: 
 	(stands up on their own, and returns to ROWING.) I’m fine Mom, no need to worry. 
Mom: 
 	(looks at Middle Child, pause, deep breath) [Youngest], can you stay here for a few minutes? I’ll just talk to your ate/kuya [Middle]. 
Youngest: 	Sure, Mom!  
 
AT RISE 	When Mom leaves, Youngest opens one of their bags and starts eating some chips from a container. Mom sits beside Middle, who has gotten very tired, and helps in ROWING. 
 
Mom: 	Let me help you, [Middle]/anak. Are you okay?  
 
Middle is silent, looking sad and withdrawn. 
 
Mom: 
 	[Middle],You’ve been very down and quiet since our vacation, you’re not eating a lot… What’s going on? 
Middle: 
 	It’s nothing, Mom. I just have a headache. 
Mom: 
 	I understand if that’s true, but… you’ve been saying that for two weeks now. I remember the other day, before we went exploring in the caves, you’ve been having nightmares about the dark. Is something troubling you at school? Are you catching a fever? 
Eldest: 
 	Don’t mind him, Mom. Everyone has bad days. Besides, he’s/she’s looking for attention ‘cause Dad broke his promise and didn’t play badminton with us during the vacation. 
Mom:  
 	Dad… I think we need to go to his pedia, just to be sure.  
Dad 	(dismissive) I’m sure he’s/she’s fine. Like [Eldest] said, it’s just part of them growing up. 
 
SFX + LIGHTS 	THUNDER RUMBLING again, even louder. Lightning flashes twice! 
LED 	Main LED: SCARY WEATHER 
KPD 	SCARY WEATHER (rainy winds, one big wave) 
AT RISE 	Waves get even bigger. The CHILDREN scream and panic, KPD WATERS reach in and take the ECO BAG WITH SNACKS. 
 
The CHILDREN drop their oars, and run to each other on the BOAT BOW. Mom and Dad run to the BOAT DECK and hold the SAIL by the ROPES as the whole boat gets pounded by wind and waves. 
 
Youngest: 
 	(tantrums) My snacks! (pulls at Eldest’s arm) Kuya No’am, we have to get them back!! 
Eldest: 
 	(consoling) There’s nothing we can do! 
Youngest: 
 	(tantrums) Now I’m getting wet from the rain! Why can’t we fly home instead of sailing?! 
Middle: 	You know we can’t afford it, [Youngest]! Here, you can have my scarf to cover you from the rain. 
 
LED 	Main LED: SCARY WEATHER WITH DISTANT MOUNTAIN  
 
Dad: 	Wait—I see a mountain up ahead! We can take shelter there for now. Kids, let’s keep a steady rhythm but don’t rush! Mom, secure the sails. Don’t let the wind rip it loose! 
 
All: 	You got it, Dad! 
 
BAND 	Start BASS DRUM beating for added tension / dramatic effect. (8bars) 
AT RISE 	Eldest (left) and Dad (right) row together on the sides. Middle goes to Mom and helps hold down the sails. Youngest goes to the BOAT BOW and looks toward the mountain. All is fine until… 
SFX 	Mom’s phone rings with a call. She takes it out from her pocket. 
 
Mom:  	(grabs phone from her pocket) Oh no! It’s Ate Lilyn from our Homeowners Council. I have to take this. 
 
Middle: 	 Mom, no! 
 
AT RISE 	Mom lets go of the rope. She declines the call but starts typing furiously. 
 
Middle: 
 	(angry) Mom, what are you doing? Answering a work call in the middle of a storm, AND on a Sunday? 
Mom: 
 	This is important! I’m leading the summer fundraising next month, and there are so many things to prepare! 
Middle: 
 	Can't you just let the others take over and lead?  
Mom: 
 	The fundraising HAS to be perfect. I can’t trust those volunteers to do things the right way, and they always tell me I’m the best person for this job! (Mom steps off the BOAT DECK and to the SIDE.) 
Middle: 	But we need you, Mom! 
 
BAND 	BASS DRUM grows more urgent.  
LED 	Main LED: SCARY WEATHER WITH MOUNTAIN & BEACH 
KPD 	SCARY WEATHER (rainy winds, even bigger waves) 
 
ONE BIG WAVE. 
 
All:  	 	Woooah!! 
 
Suddenly, KPD WINDS reach into the boat and tear away the FIRST SAIL. 
 
Middle: 	Nooo!! Our sail! 
 
Mom:  	[Middle], hold on! 
 
AT RISE 	Mom returns to the BOAT DECK. Eldest panics as KPD WATERS take a GYM BAG WITH SHOES and throw it overboard. 
SFX 	THUNDER RUMBLING 
 
Eldest: 
 	(reaching for their shoes) My rubber shoes! Dad, we have to get them back! 
Dad: 	(goes to Eldest, holds them back) [Eldest], don’t lean too far off the boat! You might fall overboard! 
 
Eldest: 
 	(upset, still reaching for the shoes) No, Dad, I can’t! I have a big tournament when school starts, and as team captain, I always need the best shoes. Dad, please! 
Dad: 
 	It’s too far out now, [Eldest], there’s nothing we can do. We’ll figure out your rubber shoes, don’t worry… 
Eldest: 
 	(getting upset) You’re always at work, so how would you know?? I’ve spent sooo many hours in training—after school, on weekends, even on holidays. And that’s on top of studying, making projects, and being part of the student council. If I don’t do my job well as captain, everything we worked hard for as a team will be for nothing! 
Dad: 
 	(a little angry) [Eldest], I understand you, okay? I really do. But just like you said earlier—this is very important, too. And right now, our family needs our full focus more than ever. 
Middle: 	(pulling hard on the mast) I think it’s gonna rip! 
 
KPD 	The SECOND SAIL rips entirely.  
BAND 	BASS DRUM reaches climax. 
LED 	Main LED: SCARY WEATHER WITH BEACH & HOUSE 
 
Youngest: 	Our sails are broken!! 
 
Dad: 	Hold on, we’re almost there! Everyone, help me throw this anchor so we can land! 
 
AT RISE 	Dad grabs the ANCHOR and gathers everyone at the BOAT BOW.  
 
Dad: 	One, two, three… throw! 
 
Everyone throws the ANCHOR into the sea. 
 
BAND 	BASS DRUM reaches climax. 
SFX 	Waves washing over the shore 
LED 	Main LED: CALM WEATHER WITH BEACH & HOUSE 
 
The BOAT runs aground, and from the BOW, everyone stumbles but doesn’t fall.
