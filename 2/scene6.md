**SCENE 6: REALITIES & WAVES**

---

<mark>*Main Display : DARKENING SKY.  The FAMILY SPEAKER is sailing out on the REBUILT BOAT.  Middle and Eldest ROW at the sides while Dad and Mom are on the BOAT BOW. Youngest is near the BOAT DECK, beside the ALTAR.* </mark>

---

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
What great weather to sail out! Are you guys ready to face the waves?

<mark>**All:**</mark>  
**Yes Dad! / Aye Aye Captain! / Let's Go!**

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(looks out and points to the audience)* </mark> Look, there's a big one coming!

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Okay everyone, let's ride this out from left to right. Ready? Aaand... waavee!

---

<mark> *AT RISE The FAMILY SPEAKER does the wave motion with their arms from LEFT to RIGHT. The KPD WAVES do the same.  They can also do it one more time to get the audience to participate more.* </mark>

---

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
That was fun!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Wait a minute --  <mark>*(gets the flashlight and points it to the sea)* </mark> **Cheska**, look. Are those your shoes? Quick, grab the rope, maybe we can still get them...

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
<mark>*(gentle)*</mark> Dad, it's okay. It's too hard to get them back now, and anyway, we must reach home before it gets dark.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
But how about your tournament? Those are your best soccer shoes!

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
And I still have another pair at home that works just fine. I'm sorry for getting angry at you earlier, Dad. Let's not worry about my shoes for now. We have a journey home to focus on. **Our family is top priority.**

---

<mark> *SFX: A phone rings. Mom grabs her phone from her pocket and looks at it.* </mark>

---


<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
And speaking of focus... <mark>*(turns her PHONE off)* </mark> My "boss" can definitely wait until Monday. Sunday is family day!

---
<mark>*Youngest Kid's stomach grumbles. He  touches his stomach and looks bashful.*</mark>

---


<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
**Jabi**, are you feeling hungry? <mark>*(reaches for their BAG and looks for a SNACK)* </mark>

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
*(shyly)* Yes... but do we still have any snacks left?

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
<mark>*(hands a SNACK to Youngest)* </mark> Here...it's not much after our snacks fell overboard, but it's all I have left.

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
<mark>*(smiles)*</mark> Thank you, kuya!

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
You're welcome!

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Look, another big wave is coming!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Alright! From right to left this time, okay? Here we go! **Three, two, one... waaave!**

---
<mark> *The FAMILY SPEAKER repeats the wave motion with their arms from RIGHT to LEFT. The KPD WAVES do the same. They can also do it one more time to get the audience to participate more.* </mark>

---

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
(falls to the floor) Ouch!

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
*(helps Middle Child)* **Xander**, are you okay? Did you get a scratch? Here-- <mark>*(gets a Band-Aid  from the FIRST AID KIT)*</mark> -- let me help you.


<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
<mark>*(gentle smile at Eldest)* </mark>Thank you, Ate Cheska. I appreciate it.

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
If you need any help, just let me know. <mark> *(holds Middle's hand)* </mark>

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
**Big wave incomiiinggg!** <mark>*(holds Eldest's other hand)* </mark>

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Together kids, wave from front to back! **Three, two, one... waaaveee!**

---
<mark>*The FAMILY SPEAKER repeats the wave motion with their arms from FRONT to BACK. The KPD WAVES do the same. They can also do it one more time to get the audience to participate more.* </mark>

---

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
I think it's not long now 'til we reach home! Dad, how far are we?

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(looks around)*  </mark>I'm not sure, actually. Let me check--  <mark>*(gets his phone, looks for signal)* </mark> If I can just get a signal...

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
<mark>*(grabs the MAP)* </mark> Dad, how about we use this map?

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(puts his phone in his pocket)* </mark> That's a great idea, Xander. So let's see here...

---
<mark>*The whole family gathers in the BOAT BOW to read the map.* </mark>

---

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Okay. I'm sure we just passed by this island here, to the south...

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
And if we go straight ahead, toward these mangroves...We'll finally reach home!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(puts the map away)* </mark> Alright, everyone, let's get to it! I see a few more waves up ahead, and they're getting bigger and bigger! From back to front now, let's BRAVE these challenging waves together! **One, two, three...WAAAVE!!**

---
<mark>*The FAMILY SPEAKER repeats the wave motion with their arms from BACK to FRONT. The KPD WAVES do the same. They can also adlib and do it TWICE to get the audience to participate.* </mark>

---

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
<mark>*(excited, points)* </mark> Look, the shore is just up ahead!

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Almost there, one last wave!! Back to front, now!


---

<mark> *The FAMILY SPEAKER repeats the wave motion with their arms from BACK to FRONT. The KPD WAVES do the same.  Dad quickly retrieves the ANCHOR ON A SHORT ROPE and ties it to the LONG ROPE.  As the FAMILY SPEAKER waves to the FRONT, Dad throws the ANCHOR ON A LONGER ROPE in front of the BRAVE LETTERS.*  </mark>

---

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
**Aaaaand, touchdown!**

---

<mark> KPD WAVES exit as the FAMILY SPEAKER arrives on the shore of the mainland, where their home is.  **Main Display**: OUTSIDE MODERN HOME </mark>
