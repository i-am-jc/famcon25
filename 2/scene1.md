We also want to go home. We're actually heading home right now, we have our bags packed and ready. How about you, families? Are your bags packed and ready? <mark>*(short response)*</mark>

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Dad, I'm sure it won't just be new memories they'll be bringing home from the FamCon. I learned yesterday that we have a beautiful purpose in God's plan, and we have to remember that! Families, were you able to take lots of pictures? <mark>*(short response)*</mark> Did you all enjoy the family got talent yesterday? <mark>*(short response)*</mark>

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Families, it's a long journey ahead of us! There might be a lot of challenges along the way, especially when we try to follow Jesus and be brothers and sisters to one another.

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
But I know that as long as we stay together, no matter the challenges, we can still meet the Lord, especially when we serve our families and our community!

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
When life gets tough, 
we always go back to our family!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
That's right! We must remember that it was the Lord who created our families, which is why our going back to Him and journeying with Him, blesses us with dignity and responsibility. <mark>*(to audience)*</mark> So families, are you ready to journey with us? <mark>*(response)*</mark>

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Families, are you ready to go back to our Lord? <mark>*(response)*</mark>
