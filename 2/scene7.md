<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
We're finally home!

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
<mark>*(chuckles)* </mark> Yeah, with fewer bags than we left with.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
*(smiling)* But more God-given lessons than we started.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
*(smiling)* Exactly, Dad. What did you kids learn from our trip?

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
I learned that life won't always be smooth-sailing, even for a family that wants to follow God. We all have different challenges, and that's normal! But we have to learn to overcome them together with God, instead of taking out our anger or frustration or exhaustion on each other.

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
When we face challenges, Jesus invites us to pause and go back to Galilee. Whenever we remember the first time we met Jesus, He renews our faith and hope to face any challenge as a family.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Yep! God calls us to take courage! Going back to our Galilee reminds us that He is with us always, until the end of time. That's why we should not be afraid when troubles come.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Instead, we pursue holiness as a family through sacraments and intentional family time, so we learn to heal together and love one another the way Jesus taught us. We should not be afraid. Instead, we should be...

<mark>**All Children:**</mark>  
**...BRAVE!**

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(addressing the audience)* </mark> Families! Are you ready to be BRAVE? <mark>*(audience response, can repeat or do adlib for audience engagement)* </mark>

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Families! Did you have fun on this BRAVE adventure with us? <mark>*(audience response, can repeat or do adlib for audience engagement)* </mark>

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
This time, we're gonna do the session activity together! Are you ready? <mark>*(wait for audience to respond)* </mark> Great! Our last activity for this FamCon session is called...

<mark>**All:**</mark>  
**FAMILY FIRST!**

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
For this activity, you will need your conference kit and writing materials. We will give you 10 seconds to bring them out! *(count down)* Does everyone have their materials? Raise them up high! *(wait for audience to respond)*

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Let's start! <mark>**On page 21 of your conference kit** </mark>, you will find the Family First activity template. Today, we will plan the different activities that each family member must actively join and be a part of. This activity plan will help us remember to prioritize and protect family activities.

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
There are 4 boxes in the template. The first box is for IMPORTANT DATES and schedules. Fill in birthdays, anniversaries, and other important dates that must not be missed or forgotten by the family. Each member must absolutely not make other plans on these dates.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
The second box is for the family's PLANNED ACTIVITIES. This can be your family vacation, family household, parent and child date, mom and dad date, and others!

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
The third box is for ACTS OF LOVE AND SERVICE. Plan activities to help others, such as helping clean the grandparents' house, sharing meals with neighbors, and visiting a sick friend at the hospital.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
The last box is called STOP DOING THIS. These are things each family member must stop doing to prioritize and share joy with the family. Some examples are: stop bringing gadgets to the dining table; for mom and dad, stop doing work after office hours; for kids, stop doing extra-curricular activities on Sundays.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Is everyone ready? (audience response) Alright! See you in 20 minutes!
