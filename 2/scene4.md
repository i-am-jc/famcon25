SCENE 4: B.R.A.V.E.

MAIN LED: LIVING ROOM INSIDE ANCESTRAL HOME
AT RISE
Middle and Eldest Child ENTER from the opposite sides of the stage. Middle is holding a SAIL REPAIR KIT and a large LETTER B.
Middle: Kuya, look! I found this near the altar.
Eldest: What’s that? A toolbox?
Middle: No, it looks like a sail repair kit. It’s got big needles, wax thread, and nylon ropes! I think it can help us fix our boat.
AT RISE
Dad, Mom, Youngest, and Caretaker arrive.
Mom: [Middle], [Eldest]! How are you both?
Eldest: We’re great, Mom. We made sandwiches in the kitchen, then went exploring. Look what [Middle] found!
Dad: A sail repair kit! Great thinking, [Middle]. Looks like it has everything we need. But what’s with this big letter B?
Middle: I don’t know. I think I saw another letter in the kitchen too…
Caretaker: (realization) [Middle], you said you found this by the altar, right? I think… I think our ancestors are trying to tell us something!
Eldest: Really? What is it?
Caretaker: Maybe our ancestors are trying to give you clues on how to get back home…
Mom: Really?? How?
Caretaker: Well, Tita, there are many ways for us to BRAVE the world as a family. Tito ____, my papa told me that when you and your siblings grew up here, Lolo and Lola always made sure you did letter B: Bonding through prayer and worship.
LED
B: Bonding through Prayer and Worship. Photo of Dad’s family or Family Speaker praying the rosary.
Caretaker: Back then, you and your family had a prayer time when everyone was present. Whether it was to pray the rosary, read the Bible, or worship God, you did it together as a family.
Dad: (realization) That’s right, I remember! Even when Nanay and Tatay were tired from work, or my siblings and I were busy with school, we always made time to pray together. (to audience) A family that prays together, stays together. By coming to God as a family, we gain the spiritual nourishment and strength to face the challenges of daily life together.
Caretaker: (looks and gestures toward the audience) Let’s look around the house and search for more clues!
Caretaker sticks LETTER B on the FRONT HULL. FAMILY SPEAKER starts going around.
Mom: (to audience) Everyone! Can you help us? Look behind you, beside you, or under your chairs. Do you see anything that might help us fix our boat?
Dad: (to audience) Please raise them high when you find something!

SIDE LED: Animation of the acronym B.R.A.V.E surrounded by question marks, to indicate that a search is going on. Acronym text must be the same (or recognizably similar) color & font as the actual letters found DOWNSTAGE.
AT RISE & DOWNSTAGE
The FAMILY SPEAKER looks around the house (ONSTAGE and DOWNSTAGE) for more items and letter clues.
Eldest Child finds R attached to a FIRST AID KIT near RIGHT DOWNSTAGE.
Dad finds A attached to a MAP in CENTER DOWNSTAGE.
Middle and Youngest Child finds V attached to BATTERIES and FLASHLIGHT in the RIGHT STAGE.
Mom finds E attached to ROPE in LEFT DOWNSTAGE.
While everyone looks for the letters and items, Caretaker brings in the ALTAR with the HOLY FAMILY IMAGE to put onstage

POWER UP INSTRUMENTAL
Dad: (to the family members) Hey everyone, did you find anything? (Youngest)? Mom?
Youngest: No, not yet!
Dad: How about you, (Eldest)?
Eldest: Still nothing! How about you, Mom?
Mom: Wait… there’s something here!
Middle: I found something too! Is (Eldest) still looking?
Family Speaker can do more adlib while searching, until they all find the ITEMS and LETTER CLUES.
Dad: Has everyone found some clues?
Family: Yes, Dad! (raises the ITEMS and LETTER CLUES)
Dad: Great! Let’s bring them all together and figure out what they mean!
AT RISE
Everyone meets DOWNSTAGE with their ITEMS and LETTER CLUES.
Eldest: Okay, I found this big letter R near this first aid kit! What could it mean?
Caretaker: Nice one! Let’s see… What does first aid have to do with the letter R?
Middle: Well, first aid can mean being healthy again.
Mom: And being healthy can also come from physical, mental, or spiritual healing.
Eldest: Spiritual healing… (realization) I think letter R means Reconciliation!
Caretaker: Yes, I think you’re right! What do you think, Tito ____?
LED
R: Reconciliation. Photo of Caretaker’s family hugging OR of Eldest Child and Lola
Dad: Well, your Lola always taught me to approach conflict with open communication. There is no healing without forgiveness. Instead of acting on our anger and hurting others, we must seek to understand and support each other.
Eldest: (nostalgic) I remember Lola telling me that, too. She said we should be loving and merciful like Jesus. That’s the only way to heal.
Dad: That’s a great lesson, [Eldest]. Let’s keep this letter for now.
Eldest Child takes FIRST AID KIT and puts LETTER R on the FRONT HULL, then returns DOWNSTAGE. MAIN LED fades back to LIVING ROOM INSIDE ANCESTRAL HOME.
Mom: Dad, what do you have there?
Dad: I found this map by the window, with the letter A attached! (gives the map to Caretaker)
Caretaker: (examines it) Hmm, this is hard. I can’t really think of anything it could mean…
Mom: (looks at the map) Kuya Jun-jun, is this the map of the entire province? (points at the map) These are the caves we visited yesterday! And if this is the mainland… (points to a different part of the map) Then this is where we are!
Youngest: Wow, so many neighborhoods around the mountain. Did Lolo also cook for them like he did for us?
Dad: He did! So I think this letter A stands for… Acts of love and service!
LED
A: Acts of Love and Service. Photo of Dad’s family doing feeding programs or other types of community service.
Caretaker: My papa also shared stories of how you guys did volunteer work as a family, whether through feeding programs, clean-up projects, seminars, or technical trainings. It was your personal way to live out the Gospel call to love.
Dad: Jun-jun, I remember when your papa and I carried pots of lugaw to our neighboring islands and shared meals with them. Truly, there’s no joy quite like being with our community.
Mom: When we do our own acts of love and service, we make Jesus very happy!
Middle: I’ll remember that!
Dad takes the MAP and puts LETTER A on the FRONT HULL, then returns DOWNSTAGE. MAIN LED fades back to LIVING ROOM INSIDE ANCESTRAL HOME.
Caretaker: [Youngest], what did you find?
Youngest: Kuya [Middle] and I found batteries, an emergency flashlight, and the letter V!
Mom: Great job! Where did you find these?
Middle: We found them by the couch near the altar. What could they mean?
Dad: Hmmm… I got it! Tatay always said we need flashlights during emergencies, like blackouts or storms. (holding up the items) These batteries power these flashlights! So maybe, our ancestors are telling us this: whenever we face challenges or storms, we need something to power us up!
Eldest: Like what, dad? Does it start with letter V?
Dad: Not really… But I think this V means V—Value the sacraments. Kids, do you remember what the sacraments are? (brief pause for audience response)
LED
V: Value the Sacraments. Photo of the family speaker in a Church
Eldest: (thinking) There’s the sacrament of Marriage, right? Also Baptism… and Confirmation.
Middle: There’s also Holy Orders, for the priests and religious! And going to confession… that’s a sacrament too. Also the Eucharist!
Youngest: Dad, dad, I remember what you told me during my first Holy Communion! It’s a very special meal because the bread is Christ’s body, and the wine is His blood, and when we eat and drink it, we remember His sacrifice on the cross because He loves us very much!
Dad: Exactly! You’re all correct, kids, very good.

STATIC SPLASH TEXT:
“The sacraments are effective signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us.” —Catechism of the Catholic Church 1131
Dad: The sacraments are an essential part of our Catholic life, because they power us up with God’s grace and presence every day.
Mom: Yes, that’s why it’s important to actively participate in them. We cannot live without Jesus in our life.
Middle: (excited) Today is Sunday right? I can’t wait to attend Mass today and receive the Eucharist again!!
Dad: (smiling) Well then, we better hurry and fix our boat so we can go to church!
Youngest Child takes the BATTERIES & FLASHLIGHT, while Middle Child puts LETTER V on the FRONT HULL. MAIN LED fades back to LIVING ROOM INSIDE ANCESTRAL HOME.
Caretaker: Tita _____, did you find this rope?
Mom: (grabs the letter E) Yes! I found it and this letter E near the dining table, but I haven’t figured out what it means yet.
Dad: (realization) I think I know! Here’s a clue: everyone enjoys this.
Eldest: (excited) Going on vacation????
Dad: That’s true… But that doesn’t start with the letter E!
Middle: So what is it, Dad? Tell us!
Dad: Well… One of the ways Nanay and Tatay made family time a priority was by making sure we do letter E—Eat together as a family.
LED
E: Eat Together. Photo of Dad’s family OR the family speaker eating together
Dad: (takes the rope from Caretaker) Just like this rope, eating together ties our bonds closer to each other. We all go hungry in different ways—physically, emotionally, socially, and even spiritually. But all of them can be fed at the family table.
Caretaker: Mama and Papa also made us practice regular family mealtime. We prepared meals together, blessed the food, and talked about anything and everything as we ate. Even washing the dishes helped us be present to each other. It makes me value being complete at the dining table, especially now that my Kuya Jayjay lives abroad.
Mom: Jun-jun, I’m sure your kuya treasures those times as well. Because by being present to one another at the dining table, we learn to appreciate even more the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.
Caretaker: (smiles) You’re right, tita. Now let’s see what our ancestors are trying to tell us with these letters!
Mom takes the ROPE, and they all go to the FRONT HULL as she puts LETTER E beside the rest of the LETTER CLUES.
MAIN LED now fades to CALM WEATHER WITH BEACH & HOUSE.
