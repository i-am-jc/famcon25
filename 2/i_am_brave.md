<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Good morning, families! <mark>*(response)*</mark>

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
I can't hear you!  good morning, families! <mark>*(response)*</mark>

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
My name is ____JC Cepe___, and this is my wife ___Twinkle___. These are our children: __Jabi___, __Xander__, __Cheska__ and last is eldest __Denise__ who is currently "working abroad". I just have one question for you, families! Who wants to go home?? <mark>*(response)*</mark>

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
We also want to go home. We're actually heading home right now, we have our bags packed and ready. How about you, families? Are your bags packed and ready? <mark>*(short response)*</mark>

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Dad, I'm sure it won't just be new memories they'll be bringing home from the FamCon. I learned yesterday that we have a beautiful purpose in God's plan, and we have to remember that! Families, have you gotten some souvenirs? <mark>*(short response)*</mark> How about some souvenir gifts for your loved ones? <mark>*(short response)*</mark>

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Families, it's a long journey ahead of us! There might be a lot of challenges along the way, especially when we try to follow Jesus and be brothers and sisters to one another.

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
But I know that as long as we stay together, no matter the challenges, we can still meet the Lord, especially when we serve our families and our community!

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
When life gets tough, we always go back to our family!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
That's right! We must remember that it was the Lord who created our families, which is why our going back to Him and journeying with Him, blesses us with dignity and responsibility. <mark>*(to audience)*</mark> So families, are you ready to journey with us? <mark>*(response)*</mark>

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Families, are you ready to go back to our Lord? <mark>*(response)*</mark>

<mark>**All:**</mark>  
**Let's go!**

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
I can't believe we finally got to visit the caves! They're sooo much more beautiful in real life.
 

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
And the water was sooo blue and sooo clear!
 

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Right?? I grew up seeing postcards and photos of the caves, but nothing compares to the real thing.

 
<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>(teasing)</mark> I bet you have your new profile photo already Mommy, don't you?

 
<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Once we get home, I'm uploading a whole album on Facebook!


<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
Please, not any embarrassing photos, Mama!

---
<mark>*SFX: Dad's phone pings with MANY NOTIFICATIONS. He takes his phone out of his pocket.*</mark>

---

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
[Eldest], can you take over here for a minute? I need to answer this quickly.
  

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
<mark>(goes to him, takes the oar and starts ROWING)</mark> Another message from work, Dada?


---

<mark>*Dad goes to the BOAT BOW, occasionally stretching his phone out for reception.*</mark>

---

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark> *(still looking at and typing on his phone*)</mark> Yes? we've been talking to this big client for weeks, and now their emails are looking very promising. We have to act fast to seal the deal!


<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
<mark>*(to Eldest)*</mark> Dad is aaaalways working. Not a day goes by without his work phone.


<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark> *(looks up quickly at Middle and Eldest Child)* </mark> I could say the same about you and your devices! <mark> *(sighs)*</mark> You're not old enough to understand yet, but we need this money. You know I love spending time with you all, but this vacation cost a lot, we still have bills to pay, and your mom and I are saving up for your college as well. That's why I need to work, always.


<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
<mark>*(sighing to themself)* </mark> I thought this was a family vacation?

<mark>*Eldest shakes their head, stops ROWING, pulls out their phone, and starts scrolling. Seeing the Eldest, Middle puts on the headphones and start listening to music. **SFX THUNDER RUMBLING** in the distance. Display **"DARKENING SKY"** in Main Display* </mark>

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
<mark> *(goes closer to Mom, holds on to her shirt)*</mark> Mommy, look at the dark clouds. I'm scared.
 
  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
<mark> *(puts arm around Youngest Child)*</mark> Oh, it's okay, **Jabi**. I'm sure we'll be fine. <mark> *(looks at Dad)*</mark> Daddy, how far are we from the mainland?

  
---
<mark>***Dad** doesn't respond and continues to type on his phone. **Mom** leaves the BOAT DECK and goes to him on the BOW.*</mark>

---
 
<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
<mark>*(clears her throat, louder voice)*</mark> **Dad**?

  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(still looking at and typing on his phone)*</mark> Hmm? Oh, not too long now. The rain won't catch us, don't worry.

<mark>**All:**</mark>  
**Woah!**

---
<mark>*AT RISE: Shocked, everyone holds on to the boat to secure themselves. On the BOAT DECK, Mom holds on to Youngest. On the SIDES, Eldest falls to the floor and Middle ignores them, and returns to ROWING. On the BOW, Dad grows unsteady but continues to type on his phone and seek reception.*</mark>

---
  
  

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Ouch!!!

  
<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
**Cheska**, are you okay? **Xander**, help her out, please.



<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
<mark> *(stands up on their own, and returns to ROWING.)*</mark> I'm fine Mommy, no need to worry.

  
  
  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
<mark>*(looks at Middle Child, pause, deep breath)*</mark> **Jabi**, can you stay here for a few minutes? I'll just talk to your **kuya Xander**.

 

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Ok Mommy.

---
<mark> * When Mom leaves, Youngest opens one of their bags and starts eating some chips from a container. Mom sits beside Middle, who has gotten very tired, and helps in ROWING.* </mark>

---
  
  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Let me help you, **Xander**. Are you okay?

  
---
<mark>*Middle is silent, looking sad and withdrawn.*</mark>

---
  
  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
**Xander**, You've been very down and quiet since our vacation, you're not eating a lot? What's going on?

 
<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
It's nothing, Momma. I just have a headache.


<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
I understand if that's true, but? you've been saying that for two weeks now. I remember the other day, before we went exploring in the caves, you've been having nightmares about the dark. Is something troubling you at school? Are you catching a fever?


<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Don't mind him, Mommy.  Everyone has bad days. Besides, he's looking for attention 'cause Daddy broke his promise and didn't play **ping pong** with us during the vacation.

  
  
  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Dad...I think we need to go to his pedia, just to be sure.

  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(dismissive)*</mark> I'm sure he's  fine. Like **Cheska** said, it's just part of growing up.

<mark>*SFX + LIGHTS: THUNDER RUMBLING again, even louder. Lightning flashes twice! LED: Main LED: SCARY WEATHER. KPD: SCARY WEATHER (rainy winds, one big wave). AT RISE: Waves get even bigger. The CHILDREN scream and panic, KPD WATERS reach in and take the ECO BAG WITH SNACKS.*</mark>


<mark>*The CHILDREN drop their oars, and run to each other on the BOAT BOW. Mom and Dad run to the BOAT DECK and hold the SAIL by the ROPES as the whole boat gets pounded by wind and waves*.</mark>

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
<mark>*(tantrums)*</mark> Haay Naku! My snacks! <mark>*(pulls at Eldest's arm)*</mark> **Ate Cheska** , we have to get them back!!


<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
<mark>(consoling)</mark> There's nothing we can do!
  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
<mark> *(tantrums)*</mark> Now I'm getting wet from the rain! Why can't we fly home instead of sailing?!

  

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
You know we can't afford it, **Jabi**! Here, you can have my jacket to cover you from the rain.

  
---
<mark>*LED: Main LED: SCARY WEATHER WITH DISTANT MOUNTAIN*</mark>

---
  
  
  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Wait! I see a mountain up ahead! We can take shelter there for now. Kids, let's keep a steady rhythm but don't rush! Mommy, secure the sails. Don't let the wind rip it loose!

  

<mark>**All:**</mark>  
**You got it, Dad!**

  
---
<mark>*BAND: Start BASS DRUM beating for added tension / dramatic effect. (8bars). AT RISE: Eldest (left) and Dad (right) row together on the sides. Middle goes to Mom and helps hold down the sails. Youngest goes to the BOAT BOW and looks toward the mountain. All is fine until...*</mark>

<mark>*SFX: Mom's phone rings with a call. She takes it out from her pocket.*</mark>
  
---
  
  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
<mark> *(grabs phone from her pocket)*</mark> Oh no! It's Ms. Casandra from the Parish Fundraiser. I have to take this.

  

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
**Mommy, no!**

  
---
  <mark>Mom lets go of the rope. She declines the call but starts typing furiously.</mark>

---
  
  
  

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
<mark>(angry)</mark> Mom, what are you doing? Answering a work call in the middle of a storm, AND on a Sunday?

  
  
  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
This is important! I'm leading the Christmas fundraiser next month, and there are so many things to prepare!

  

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
Can't you just let the others take over and lead?

  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
The fundraiser HAS to be perfect. I can't trust the other volunteers to do things the right way, and they always tell me I'm the best person for this job! <mark>  *(Mom steps off the BOAT DECK and to the SIDE.)*</mark>

  
  
  

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
But we need you, Mom!

<mark>Suddenly, KPD WINDS reach into the boat and tear away the FIRST SAIL.</mark>

---
  
  

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
Nooo!! Our sail!

  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
**Xander**, hold on!

  
---
<mark>Mom returns to the BOAT DECK. Eldest panics as ***KPD WATERS*** take a GYM BAG WITH SHOES and throw it overboard. SFX: THUNDER RUMBLING</mark>

---
  
  
  

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
<mark>*(reaching for their shoes)*</mark> My soccer shoes! Daddy, we have to get them back!

 
  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>(goes to Eldest, holds them back)</mark> [Eldest], don't lean too far off the boat! You might fall overboard!


  

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
<mark>(upset, still reaching for the shoes)</mark> No, Dad, I can't! I have a big tournament when school starts, and as team captain, I always need the best shoes. Dad, please!

  
  
  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
It's too far out now, **Cheska**, there's nothing we can do. We'll figure out your soccer shoes, don't worry...

  
  
  

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
<mark>(getting upset)</mark> You're always at work, so how would you know?? I've spent sooo many hours in training... after school, on weekends, even on holidays. And that's on top of studying, making projects, and being part of the Honors Society. If I don't do my job well as captain, everything we worked hard for as a team will be for nothing!

  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(a little angry)*</mark> **Cheska**, I understand you, okay? I really do. But just like you said earlier, this is very important, too. And right now, our family needs our full focus more than ever.
  
  
  

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Hold on, we're almost there! Everyone, help me throw this anchor so we can land!

<mark> *Dad grabs the ANCHOR and gathers everyone at the BOAT BOW.*</mark>

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Everyone alright? **Jabi?, Xander?, Cheska?**
  

<mark>**Children:**</mark>  
I'm here, Dad! I'm alright! We're okay, dad!

  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
We made it, praise God!

  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
But what about our stuff? We lost everything!

  
<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
Yeah, how are we going to get back home? Are we stuck here forever??????

  

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Wait, I know this place! Dad...that's the house you grew up in, right? I remember your childhood pictures!

  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Yes, that's the **Cepe Family** ancestral house. Look, someone's coming!

  
---
<mark> *The CARETAKER enters: warm and friendly, and holding a NATIVE HAT from forest work.* </mark>

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
I saw your shipwreck! How is everyone doing?
  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Hello! Do you know the **Cepes**?

  

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Yes! I live in the house next door. Are you...  wait, **Tito JC**??


<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Yeah! You must be **Mike**, then,  Eldest son of the brother-in-law of my Dad's Cousin, what's his name again....ah...Tito Rodel?


<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Ah, no... **Kuya Mike** now lives in another city, in Irving Texas. I'm **Rainier**, the youngest.
  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
**Rainier**! You were just a baby when I last saw you! You remember your **Tita Twinkle**? 

  

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Yes, **Tita Twinkle**! (mano)

  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
**Rainier**!!! You're so big already.

  

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
How are you po? How is your family? I saw your boat crash in that storm! Do you need help?
  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
We're alright... We just had our family vacation visiting the caves on the nearby island. But as we were heading back, the waves just got bigger and bigger!

  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Now our kids are very upset. Look at our boat, our things... How will we ever make it back?

  

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
<mark>*(sad)*</mark> I'm sorry to hear that, Tito... maybe your kids can rest inside first? There's food, water, some extra clothes... The bedroom is clean, but they can also stay in the guest room.


<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Thank you. Cheska, Xander, Jabi, come here... this is your **Tito  Rainier**, Tito Rodel's youngest son... He'll help us fix our boat. **Cheska**, you remember the house, right? Could you... Maybe if you... <mark> *(stuttering, as Dad is tired and overwhelmed.)* </mark>

  

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Sure, Dad. Xander, Jabi, let's get something to eat. Hi Tito Rainier! (High Five!)
  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
I want to help fix the boat!

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
<mark>*(still pissed, arms crossed, stomping away)* </mark>Whatever...


  ---

<mark>*The ELDEST and MIDDLE Child leave. Mom and the Caretaker move BOAT HULLS and PADDLES. Mom tries to adjust the SAILS.
Dad is visibly frustrated and overwhelmed as he also picks up some of the ROWING SEATS. The YOUNGEST approaches him.*</mark>

---
  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Dad, is this really where you grew up?
  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Yes,Jabi. When I was your age, this place was my home!

  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Then why are you so sad? :(

  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
*(sighing, hugs the YOUNGEST)* Hayyy, Jabi...

  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
We'll make it back, Dad! God will make a way!

  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(smiling)*</mark> Yes, that's true. Anyway, can you help Mommy put back the sail?

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Sure, Dad!

  
---

<mark>*The Caretaker has been hearing their whole conversation. As the Youngest leaves, Dad tries to carry one of the ROWING SEATS...obviously struggling... and the Caretaker catches it before the seat could slip.*</mark>

---
  

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
I got you!

  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Ah... thanks, **Rainier**. <mark>*(tired. They put down the SEAT somewhere else.)*</mark>

  

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Tito, I'm so glad you found your way back here. The last time we saw you was, I think... was 2017?  8 years ago? During the town fiesta?

  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Yes. It's been so hard to make time for vacations or reunions, with so many things happening at work, and with your **Tita Twinkle**  helping run the Church Fundraiser and different committees. But... I am still so thankful that our family saw the ancestral home again. *(pause to look at the house)* Actually, this house is where I first encountered Jesus.

  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Really, Dad? Jesus lives here, in your house??

  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
*(laughing)* No, **Jabi**. This house is where my parents taught me many valuable lessons about life. I still use them even as I'm older, and now I share them to you and your siblings as you grow up.

  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
You mean like lessons on how to sail a boat?

<mark> "Parents are the primary educators of their children, responsible for teaching them values, faith, and moral principles. God encourages parents to create a nurturing environment where children can grow in love and faith." ...St. Pope John Paul II </mark>

---
  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
*(laughing)* Yes! But more importantly, this is where my parents first introduced me to God. This is where they taught me about right and wrong, about loving our neighbor, and that being kind and respectful to others makes Jesus very happy!  <mark>*(proudly)* </mark> This place is my Galilee.

  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
**Tito Rain**, Dad was very brave! During the storm, he told us: do not be afraid! Didn't Jesus also tell that to His disciples?

  

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Yes! Jesus was also very brave, in telling the people to avoid sin and go back to God, our Father in heaven. But Jesus did not stop there. He told his disciples, "*Go to Galilee. There, you will see Me.*"

  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Dad, what's Galilee? And what does it have to do with Jesus?

<mark>*The Caretaker goes to the back and starts checking the sails, trying to repair them but keeps failing. Then he starts readjusting ROWING SEATS.* </mark>

<mark>**LED STATIC SPLASH IMAGE: Map of Galilee during the time of Jesus** </mark>

---
  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Galilee, **Jabi**, is a region in the country of Israel, where Jesus began His mission to bring us closer to His Father in heaven. Galilee is where He called many of his disciples to follow Him. It's also where He did many miracles, like when He fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish, and when he calmed a storm and walked on water!

  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
That's so cool, Dada! Mommy, can we go to Galilee for our next family vacation? I want to meet Jesus!

  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Oh! I wish we could. But we don't have to fly or sail to Israel to meet Jesus. Galilee is wherever or whenever Jesus Christ meets us, talks to us, and calls us to follow Him. Just like how Galilee was where Jesus called many of his first disciples, all of us have our own unique versions of Galilee.

  
<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
That's right. Galilee can be where God calls us to be a good friend, a helpful classmate, or a kind brother and sister to our siblings. Sometimes, Galilee refers to the moments when God calls us on a specific mission: to love other people, serve the community, or help those in need.

  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Dad, remember our camping trip last year with other kids and their fathers? There was a part we were both crying good tears, because we were talking about big feelings. I really loved that time with you. Was Jesus with us in that camping trip?

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(hugs the Youngest)*</mark> I really believe so, **Jabi**. The family is where we share and grow in faith. Remember your **kuya Xander**'s favorite Bible verse? Love is patient, love is kind...

  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
I know that! Love is not jealous, love is not proud. Love doesn't get angry easily.

  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
...And love always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres. Very good, **Jabi**. *<mark>(to audience)*</mark> The family is where each member can experience and be strengthened by love. That's why the family is everyone's first Galilee. The family is where every human being first encounters Jesus in their loved ones.

That's why when we experience today's challenges, Jesus calls us back to our Galilee...to go home and encounter God again through our family. And even in our ordinary moments together, we and our children can grow in faith as we strive to follow Jesus every day.

<mark>*The Caretaker places a ROWING SEAT near Mom and Dad.* </mark>

---
  

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Tito JC, Tita Twinkle... you know, I can't help but wonder: what if God was trying to tell you something when your family boat ended up here... Back home in Tito JC's ancestral house? Didn't you say you suddenly saw the mountain, even if the waves were so big and scary?

  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark> *(looking around at their ruined boat)* </mark> Yeah, this was... kind of a mysterious way to come home. But you know, now that I think about it... I believe that's what God wants for our family. He wants us to meet Him in our homes, with our loved ones. Those challenges, like today's digital culture and mental health issues, or lack of family time because of work, extracurriculars, or financial matters... those are realities of life that all of us must take on together, as a family. And we can only do that when it is Jesus, our Good Shepherd, who leads the way.

  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Amen, Dad. It's Jesus who renews our faith and hope. <mark>*(to audience)*</mark> And like how Jesus told His disciples to meet Him in Galilee, our families are also called to go back home to our loved ones, to prioritize our family in all our decision-making. Because our families, next to Jesus, are the greatest gift we can ever receive. You may have a high position at work, in society, or community, but you are irreplaceable at home.

<mark>*The YOUNGEST quietly steps onto the ROWING SEAT to be level with Mom, Dad, and the Caretaker.*</mark>

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Oh Jabi, I missed you too! (they hug, the YOUNGEST standing on the ROWING SEAT). All of you, even your older siblings, are so important to me. And this vacation reminded me to put our family at the top of my priority list.

 

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Me too! We'll face a lot more challenges as we head back to our own home, but I know that the Lord is with us... in our past, in our present, and in our future. Amen?

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
So Tito JC, Tita Twinkle, about your boat... I don't have the right materials to fix it right now. But you could check inside the ancestral house... or explore the area for anything that might help.

  

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Sure, Rainier! I bet Cheska and Xander are well-rested by now. Jabi, do you want to rest too?

  

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
No thanks, Dad. I want to go exploring!!

  

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Alright, then. Let's find a way to fix our boat!

<mark> *MAIN Display : LIVING ROOM INSIDE ANCESTRAL HOME.  Middle and Eldest Child ENTER from the opposite sides of the stage. Middle is holding a SAIL REPAIR KIT and a large LETTER B.* </mark>

---

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>   
Ate Cheska, look! I found this near the altar.

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>    
What's that? A toolbox?

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
No, it looks like a sail repair kit. It's got big needles, wax thread, and nylon ropes! I think it can help us fix our boat.

---
<mark>*Dad, Mom, Youngest, and Caretaker arrive.* </mark>

---

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Xander, Cheska! How are you both?

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>    
We're great, Mom. We made sandwiches in the kitchen, then went exploring. Look what Xander found!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
A sail repair kit! Great thinking, Xander.  Looks like it has everything we need. But what's with this big letter B?

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
I don't know. I think I saw another letter in the kitchen too?

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
<mark>*(realization)* </mark> **Xander**, you said you found this by the altar, right? I think? I think our ancestors are trying to tell us something!

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Really? What is it?

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Maybe our ancestors are trying to give you clues on how to get back home?

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Really?? How?

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Well, Tita, there are many ways for us to BRAVE the world as a family. Tito JC, my papa told me that when you and your siblings grew up here, Lolo and Lola always made sure you did letter B: Bonding through prayer and worship.

---
<mark>*Display B: Bonding through Prayer and Worship. Photo of Dad's family or Family Speaker praying the rosary.* </mark>

---

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Back then, you and your family had a prayer time when everyone was present. Whether it was to pray the rosary, read the Bible, or worship God, you did it together as a family.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(realization)* </mark> That's right, I remember! Even when Mama and Papa were tired from work, or my siblings and I were busy with school, we always made time to pray together. *(to audience)* A family that prays together, stays together. By coming to God as a family, we gain the spiritual nourishment and strength to face the challenges of daily life together.

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
<mark>*(looks and gestures toward the audience)*</mark> Let's look around the house and search for more clues!

---
<mark>*Caretaker sticks LETTER B on the FRONT HULL. FAMILY SPEAKER starts going around.*</mark>

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
<mark>*(to audience)* </mark> Everyone! Can you help us? Look behind you, beside you, or under your chairs. Do you see anything that might help us fix our boat?

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(to audience)* </mark> Please raise them high when you find something!

---
**#todo, need to figure out how to do this with what is available...**

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(to the family members)* </mark>Hey everyone, did you find anything? Jabi? Mom?

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
No, not yet!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
How about you, Cheska?

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Still nothing! How about you, Mom?

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Wait? there's something here!

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
I found something too! Is **Ate Cheska** still looking?

---

<mark> *Family Speaker can do more adlib while searching, until they all find the ITEMS and LETTER CLUES.*  </mark>

---

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Has everyone found some clues?

<mark>**Family:**</mark>  
Yes, Dad! <mark>*(raises the ITEMS and LETTER CLUES)* </mark>

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Great! Let's bring them all together and figure out what they mean!

---
<mark>*Everyone meets DOWNSTAGE with their ITEMS and LETTER CLUES.* </mark>

---

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Okay, I found this big letter R near this first aid kit! What could it mean?

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Nice one! Let's see? What does first aid have to do with the letter R?

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
Well, first aid can mean being healthy again.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
And being healthy can also come from physical, mental, or spiritual healing.

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Spiritual healing? <mark>*(realization)* </mark> I think letter **R means Reconciliation**!

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Yes, I think you're right! What do you think, Tito JC?

---
<mark>**LED:  R: Reconciliation. Photo of Caretaker's family hugging OR of Eldest Child and Lola** </mark>

---

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Well, your Lola always taught me to approach conflict with open communication. There is no healing without forgiveness. Instead of acting on our anger and hurting others, we must seek to understand and support each other.

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
(nostalgic) I remember Lola telling me that, too. She said we should be loving and merciful like Jesus. That's the only way to heal.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
That's a great lesson, **Cheska**. Let's keep this letter for now.

---
<mark> *Eldest Child takes FIRST AID KIT and puts LETTER R on the FRONT HULL, then returns DOWNSTAGE. MAIN LED fades back to LIVING ROOM INSIDE ANCESTRAL HOME.* </mark>

---

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Dad, what do you have there?

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
I found this map by the window, with the letter A attached! *(gives the map to Caretaker)*

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
<mark>*(examines it)* </mark> Hmm, this is hard. I can't really think of anything it could mean?

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
<mark>*(looks at the map)* </mark> **Tito Rain**, is this the map of the entire province? *(points at the map)* These are the caves we visited yesterday! And if this is the mainland? *(points to a different part of the map)* Then this is where we are!

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Wow, so many neighborhoods around the mountain. Did Mamita also cook for them like she did for us?

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
She did! So I think this letter **A stands for? Acts of love and service!**

---
<mark>**LED A: Acts of Love and Service. Photo of Dad's family doing feeding programs or other types of community service.** </mark>

---

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
My papa also shared stories of how you guys did volunteer work as a family, whether through feeding programs, clean-up projects, seminars, or technical trainings. It was your personal way to live out the Gospel call to love.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
**Rainier**, I remember when your papa and I carried pots of arroz caldo to our neighboring islands and shared meals with them. Truly, there's no joy quite like being with our community.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
When we do our own acts of love and service, we make Jesus very happy!

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
I'll remember that!

<mark>*Dad takes the MAP and puts LETTER A on the FRONT HULL, then returns DOWNSTAGE. MAIN LED fades back to LIVING ROOM INSIDE ANCESTRAL HOME.* </mark>

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
**Jabi**, what did you find?

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Kuya Xander and I found batteries, an emergency flashlight, and the **letter V!**

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Great job! Where did you find these?

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
We found them by the couch near the altar. What could they mean?

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Hmmm? I got it! Gpop always said we need flashlights during emergencies, like blackouts or storms. <mark>*(holding up the items)* </mark>These batteries power these flashlights! So maybe, our ancestors are telling us this: whenever we face challenges or storms, we need something to power us up!

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Like what, dad? Does it start with **letter V?**

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Not really? But I think this V means ? **Value the sacraments**. Kids, do you remember what the sacraments are? <mark>*(brief pause for audience response)* </mark>

---
<mark>*LED V: Value the Sacraments. Photo of the family speaker in a Church* </mark>

---

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
<mark>*(thinking)*</mark> There's the sacrament of Marriage, right? Also Baptism? and Confirmation.

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
There's also Holy Orders, for the priests and religious! And going to confession? that's a sacrament too. Also the Eucharist!

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
Dad, dad, I remember what you told me during my first Holy Communion! It's a very special meal because the bread is Christ's body, and the wine is His blood, and when we eat and drink it, we remember His sacrifice on the cross because He loves us very much!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Exactly! You're all correct, kids, very good.

<mark>"The sacraments are effective signs of grace, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, by which divine life is dispensed to us." ?Catechism of the Catholic Church 1131*</mark>

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
The sacraments are an essential part of our Catholic life, because they power us up with God's grace and presence every day.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Yes, that's why it's important to actively participate in them. We cannot live without Jesus in our life.

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
<mark>*(excited)* </mark> Good thing we were able to hear mass early today before setting sail! I'm always looking forward to attend Mass every Sunday and receive the Eucharist !!!

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Tita Twinkle, did you find this rope?

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
<mark>*(grabs the letter E)* </mark>Yes! I found it and this letter E near the dining table, but I haven't figured out what it means yet.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(realization)*</mark> I think I know! Here's a clue: everyone enjoys this.

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
(excited) Going on vacation????

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
That's true? But that doesn't start with the letter E!

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
So what is it, Dad? Tell us!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Well? One of the ways Gpop and Mamita made family time a priority was by making sure we do **letter E ? -- Eat together as a family.**

---
<mark>*LED E: Eat Together. Photo of Dad's family OR the family speaker eating together*</mark>

---

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(takes the rope from Caretaker)* </mark>Just like this rope, eating together ties our bonds closer to each other. We all go hungry in different ways? physically, emotionally, socially, and even spiritually. But all of them can be fed at the family table.

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Mama and Papa also made us practice regular family mealtime. We prepared meals together, blessed the food, and talked about anything and everything as we ate. Even washing the dishes helped us be present to each other. It makes me value being complete at the dining table, especially now that my **Kuya Mike** lives far.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
**Rain**, I'm sure your kuya treasures those times as well. Because by being present to one another at the dining table, we learn to appreciate even more the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
*(smiles)* You're right, tita. Now let's see what our ancestors are trying to tell us with these letters!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark> *(to audience)* </mark>  Alright everyone, what does that spell? <mark> *(audience response)*<mark>   Louder, I can't hear you! What does that spell?

<mark>**Children:**</mark>  
BRAVE!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Right, BRAVE! That's what our ancestors are trying to tell us. Our family needs to be BRAVE! And I think we found everything we need to sail again. Right, Mom?

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
But will these tools be enough when we face those giant waves?

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Yeah, what if our boat gets ruined again?

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
You know kids, waves can be big and scary—but they can also be big and FUN! Especially if you face it together as a family and with Jesus!

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
The realities we faced earlier are just a few of the many challenges that families face today. When fears come our way, Jesus invites us to go back to our Galilee, where He can meet us and strengthen us again. And the family— our family, is our first Galilee.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Just like when He told His disciples: "Do not be afraid, there you will see me." Jesus calls us to be BRAVE because He is always with us!

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Oh tito, that reminds me!   <mark> * (Caretaker retrieves the IMAGE OF THE HOLY FAMILY and gives it to Dad.)* </mark> 

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Pursuing holiness as a family is a journey you take together. Each one of you  <mark> *(points to the FAMILY SPEAKER individually)* </mark>  plays a role in facing the challenges you encounter, so you can grow closer to God and one another. So, how can you be BRAVE and overcome your realities as a family?

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
We can lessen screen time and be more present whenever we're together. We have to protect our family time together!

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
We can serve one another and our neighbors more often.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
We'll make family time urgent and important.

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
I'll be grateful for my parents' sacrifices!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
And we'll make God the center of our family, no matter the challenges.

---

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
<mark> *(smiles)* </mark>  Exactly! And when each member strives to be GOOD AND HOLY by praying together, receiving the sacraments, and serving the community, your family will reflect Christ's love in the world.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
For now, we must return to our Galilee— our own households. Kids, are you ready to go home?

<mark>**Children:**</mark>  
**Yes!**

## SESSION SONG: GOOD AND HOLY

**VERSE:**  
Like Jesus lived in Galilee,  
We are blessed with a family  
Growing every day in faith,  
Jesus said: Be not afraid (good and holy)  

**REFRAIN**  
We are brave, so we love  
We are brave, so we forgive  
We are brave, so we rejoice  
In what we are meant to be:  

**CHORUS**  
Good and holy, good and holy  
As we journey with our family  
God is calling you and me today  
It's time for us to be brave!  

**OUTRO**  
Good and holy, let's be good and holy  
Good and holy, it's time for us to... (be not afraid)  
Good and holy, let's be good and holy  
Good and holy, it's time for us to be brave!

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
<mark>*(gentle)*</mark> Dad, it's okay. It's too hard to get them back now, and anyway, we must reach home before it gets dark.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
But how about your tournament? Those are your best soccer shoes!

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
And I still have another pair at home that works just fine. I'm sorry for getting angry at you earlier, Dad. Let's not worry about my shoes for now. We have a journey home to focus on. **Our family is top priority.**

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
We're finally home!

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
<mark>*(chuckles)* </mark> Yeah, with fewer bags than we left with.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
*(smiling)* But more God-given lessons than we started.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
*(smiling)* Exactly, Dad. What did you kids learn from our trip?

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
I learned that life won't always be smooth-sailing, even for a family that wants to follow God. We all have different challenges, and that's normal! But we have to learn to overcome them together with God, instead of taking out our anger or frustration or exhaustion on each other.

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
When we face challenges, Jesus invites us to pause and go back to Galilee. Whenever we remember the first time we met Jesus, He renews our faith and hope to face any challenge as a family.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Yep! God calls us to take courage! Going back to our Galilee reminds us that He is with us always, until the end of time. That's why we should not be afraid when troubles come.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Instead, we pursue holiness as a family through sacraments and intentional family time, so we learn to heal together and love one another the way Jesus taught us. We should not be afraid. Instead, we should be...

<mark>**All Children:**</mark>  
**...BRAVE!**

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(addressing the audience)* </mark> Families! Are you ready to be BRAVE? <mark>*(audience response, can repeat or do adlib for audience engagement)* </mark>

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Families! Did you have fun on this BRAVE adventure with us? <mark>*(audience response, can repeat or do adlib for audience engagement)* </mark>

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
This time, we're gonna do the session activity together! Are you ready? <mark>*(wait for audience to respond)* </mark> Great! Our last activity for this FamCon session is called...

<mark>**All:**</mark>  
**FAMILY FIRST!**


---
<mark>**Main Display: SESSION ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS.** </mark>

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
For this activity, you will need your conference kit and writing materials. We will give you 10 seconds to bring them out! *(count down)* Does everyone have their materials? Raise them up high! *(wait for audience to respond)*

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Let's start! <mark>**On page 21 of your conference kit** </mark>, you will find the Family First activity template. Today, we will plan the different activities that each family member must actively join and be a part of. This activity plan will help us remember to prioritize and protect family activities.

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
There are 4 boxes in the template. The first box is for IMPORTANT DATES and schedules. Fill in birthdays, anniversaries, and other important dates that must not be missed or forgotten by the family. Each member must absolutely not make other plans on these dates.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
The second box is for the family's PLANNED ACTIVITIES. This can be your family vacation, family household, parent and child date, mom and dad date, and others!

The third box is for ACTS OF LOVE AND SERVICE. Plan activities to help others, such as helping clean the grandparents' house, sharing meals with neighbors, and visiting a sick friend at the hospital.

The last box is called STOP DOING THIS. These are things each family member must stop doing to prioritize and share joy with the family. Some examples are: stop bringing gadgets to the dining table; for mom and dad, stop doing work after office hours; for kids, stop doing extra-curricular activities on Sundays.
