<mark> Put away the table cloth waves </mark>

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Everyone alright? **Jabi?, Xander?, Cheska?**

<mark>**Children:**</mark>  
I'm here, Dad! I'm alright! We're okay, dad!

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
We made it, praise God!

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
But what about our stuff? 
We lost everything!

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
Yeah, how are we going to get back home? Are we stuck here forever??????

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Wait, I know this place! Dad...that's the house you grew up in, right? I remember your childhood pictures!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Yes, that's the **Cepe Family** ancestral house. Look, someone's coming!

---
<mark> *The CARETAKER enters: warm and friendly, and holding a NATIVE HAT from forest work.* </mark> 

---

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
I saw your shipwreck! How is everyone doing?

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Hello! Do you know the **Cepes**?

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Yes! I live in the house next door. Are you...  wait, **Tito JC**??

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Yeah! You must be **Mike**, then,  Eldest son of the brother-in-law of my Dad's Cousin, what's his name again....ah...Tito Rodel?

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Ah, no... **Kuya Mike** now lives in another city, in Irving Texas. I'm **Rainier**, the youngest.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
**Rainier**! You were just a baby when I last saw you! You remember your **Tita Twinkle**? 

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Yes, **Tita Twinkle**! (mano)

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
**Rainier**!!! You're so big already.

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
How are you po? How is your family? I saw your boat crash in that storm! Do you need help?

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
We're alright... We just had our family vacation visiting the caves on the nearby island. But as we were heading back, the waves just got bigger and bigger!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Now our kids are very upset. Look at our boat, our things... How will we ever make it back?

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
<mark>*(sad)*</mark> I'm sorry to hear that, Tito... maybe your kids can rest inside first? There's food, water, some extra clothes... The bedroom is clean, but they can also stay in the guest room.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Thank you. Cheska, Xander, Jabi, come here... this is your **Tito  Rainier**, Tito Rodel's youngest son... He'll help us fix our boat. **Cheska**, you remember the house, right? Could you... Maybe if you... <mark> *(stuttering, as Dad is tired and overwhelmed.)* </mark>

<mark>**Eldest:**</mark>  
Sure, Dad. Xander, Jabi, let's get something to eat. Hi Tito Rainier! (High Five!)

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
I want to help fix the boat!

<mark>**Middle:**</mark>  
<mark>*(still pissed, arms crossed, stomping away)* </mark>Whatever...

---

<mark>*The ELDEST and MIDDLE Child leave **EXIT RIGHT**. Mom and the Caretaker move BOAT HULLS and PADDLES. Mom tries to adjust the SAILS.
Dad is visibly frustrated and overwhelmed as he also picks up some of the ROWING SEATS. The YOUNGEST approaches him.*</mark>

---

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Dad, is this really where you grew up?

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Yes,Jabi. When I was your age, this place was my home!

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Then why are you so sad? :(

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark> *(sighing, hugs the YOUNGEST)* </mark>  Hayyy, Jabi...

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
We'll make it back, Dad! 
God will make a way!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(smiling)*</mark> Yes, that's true. Anyway, can you help Mommy put back the sail?

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Sure, Dad!

---

<mark>*The Caretaker has been hearing their whole conversation. As the Youngest leaves, Dad tries to carry one of the ROWING SEATS...obviously struggling... and the Caretaker catches it before the seat could slip.*</mark>

---

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
I got you!

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Ah... thanks, **Rainier**. <mark>*(tired. They put down the SEAT somewhere else.)*</mark>

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Tito, I'm so glad you found your way back here. The last time we saw you was, I think... was 2017?  8 years ago? During the town fiesta?

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Yes. It's been so hard to make time for vacations or reunions, with so many things happening at work, and with your **Tita Twinkle**  helping run the Church Fundraiser and different committees. But... I am still so thankful that our family saw the ancestral home again. *(pause to look at the house)* Actually, this house is where I first encountered Jesus.

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Really, Dad? 
Jesus lives here, in your house??

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
*(laughing)* No, **Jabi**. This house is where my parents taught me many valuable lessons about life. I still use them even as I'm older, and now I share them to you and your siblings as you grow up.

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
You mean like lessons on how to sail a boat?

---

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
*(laughing)* Yes! But more importantly, this is where my parents first introduced me to God. This is where they taught me about right and wrong, about loving our neighbor, and that being kind and respectful to others makes Jesus very happy!  <mark>*(proudly)* </mark> This place is my Galilee.

<mark> **Revert to Scene Calm Waters (BEACH & HOUSE)**</mark>

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
**Tito Rain**, Dad was very brave! 
During the storm, he told us: do not be afraid! 
Didn't Jesus also tell that to His disciples?

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Yes! Jesus was also very brave, in telling the people to avoid sin and go back to God, our Father in heaven. But Jesus did not stop there. He told his disciples, "*Go to Galilee. There, you will see Me.*"

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Dad, what's Galilee? 
And what does it have to do with Jesus?

  

---

<mark>*The Caretaker goes to the back and starts checking the sails, trying to repair them but keeps failing. Then he starts readjusting ROWING SEATS.* </mark>

<mark>**LED STATIC SPLASH IMAGE: Map of Galilee during the time of Jesus** </mark>

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Galilee, **Jabi**, is a region in the country of Israel, where Jesus began His mission to bring us closer to His Father in heaven. Galilee is where He called many of his disciples to follow Him. It's also where He did many miracles, like when He fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish, and when he calmed a storm and walked on water!

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
That's so cool, Dada! 
Mommy, can we go to Galilee for our next family vacation? 
I want to meet Jesus!

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Oh! I wish we could. But we don't have to fly or sail to Israel to meet Jesus. Galilee is wherever or whenever Jesus Christ meets us, talks to us, and calls us to follow Him. Just like how Galilee was where Jesus called many of his first disciples, all of us have our own unique versions of Galilee.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
That's right. Galilee can be where God calls us to be a good friend, a helpful classmate, or a kind brother and sister to our siblings. Sometimes, Galilee refers to the moments when God calls us on a specific mission: to love other people, serve the community, or help those in need.

<mark> **Revert to Scene Calm Waters (BEACH & HOUSE)**</mark>

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Dad, remember our camping trip last year with other kids and their fathers? 
There was a part we were both crying good tears, 
because we were talking about big feelings. 
I really loved that time with you. 
Was Jesus with us in that camping trip? 

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark>*(hugs the Youngest)*</mark> I really believe so, **Jabi**.

<mark>"Our family is a place of encounter with God. Love is experienced and nurtured in the daily lives of couples and their children." ...Familiaris Consortio </mark>

---

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
The family is where we share and grow in faith. Remember your **kuya Xander**'s favorite Bible verse? Love is patient, love is kind...

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
I know that! 
Love is not jealous, 
love is not proud. 
Love doesn't get angry easily.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
...And love always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres. Very good, **Jabi**. *<mark>(to audience)*</mark> The family is where each member can experience and be strengthened by love. That's why...

  
---
<mark>**LED STATIC SPLASH TEXT:**  "The family is everyone's first Galilee. The family is where every human being first encounters Jesus in their loved ones." </mark>

---

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
... the family is everyone's first Galilee. The family is where every human being first encounters Jesus in their loved ones.
That's why when we experience today's challenges, Jesus calls us back to our Galilee...to go home and encounter God again through our family. And even in our ordinary moments together, we and our children can grow in faith as we strive to follow Jesus every day.

<mark>*The Caretaker places a ROWING SEAT near Mom and Dad.* </mark>

---

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
Tito JC, Tita Twinkle... you know, I can't help but wonder: what if God was trying to tell you something when your family boat ended up here... Back home in Tito JC's ancestral house? Didn't you say you suddenly saw the mountain, even if the waves were so big and scary?

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
<mark> *(looking around at their ruined boat)* </mark> Yeah, this was... kind of a mysterious way to come home. But you know, now that I think about it... I believe that's what God wants for our family. He wants us to meet Him in our homes, with our loved ones. Those challenges, like today's digital culture and mental health issues, or lack of family time because of work, extracurriculars, or financial matters... those are realities of life that all of us must take on together, as a family. And we can only do that when it is Jesus, our Good Shepherd, who leads the way.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Amen, Dad. It's Jesus who renews our faith and hope. <mark>*(to audience)*</mark> And like how Jesus told His disciples to meet Him in Galilee, our families are also called to go back home to our loved ones, to prioritize our family in all our decision-making. Because our families, next to Jesus, are the greatest gift we can ever receive. You may have a high position at work, in society, or community, but you are irreplaceable at home.

<mark>*The YOUNGEST quietly steps onto the ROWING SEAT to be level with Mom, Dad, and the Caretaker.*</mark>

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
Mommy, Daddy, I miss you at home!

---

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Oh Jabi, I missed you too! (they hug, the YOUNGEST standing on the ROWING SEAT). All of you, even your older siblings, are so important to me. And this vacation reminded me to put our family at the top of my priority list.

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Me too! We'll face a lot more challenges as we head back to our own home, but I know that the Lord is with us... in our past, in our present, and in our future. Amen?

<mark>**All:**</mark>  
**Amen!**

<mark> **Revert to Scene Calm Waters (BEACH & HOUSE)**</mark>

<mark>**Caretaker:**</mark>  
So Tito JC, Tita Twinkle, about your boat... I don't have the right materials to fix it right now. But you could check inside the ancestral house... or explore the area for anything that might help.

<mark>**Dad:**</mark>  
Sure, Rainier! I bet Cheska and Xander are well-rested by now. Jabi, do you want to rest too?

<mark>**Youngest:**</mark>  
No thanks, Dad. 
I want to go exploring!!

<mark>**Mom:**</mark>  
Alright, then. Let's find a way to fix our boat!

<mark> **Dad, Mom, Youngest**, and **Caretaker** **EXIT LEFT** </mark>
