AT RISE
The BOAT is still mostly ruined, but the LETTER CLUES are now visible upon the FRONT HULL. It spells the word “BRAVE”
Dad: (to audience) Alright everyone, what does that spell? (audience response) Louder, I can’t hear you! What does that spell?
Children: BRAVE!
Dad: Right, BRAVE! That’s what our ancestors are trying to tell us. Our family needs to be BRAVE! And I think we found everything we need to sail again. Right, Mom?
Middle: But will these tools be enough when we face those giant waves?
Youngest: Yeah, what if our boat gets ruined again?
Caretaker: You know kids, waves can be big and scary—but they can also be big and FUN! Especially if you face it together as a family and with Jesus!

STATIC SPLASH TEXT:
“Everyone must consider his every neighbor without exception as another self, taking into account first of all His life and the means necessary to living it with dignity” —Gaudium et Spes 27
Mom: The realities we faced earlier are just a few of the many challenges that families face today. When fears come our way, Jesus invites us to go back to our Galilee, where He can meet us and strengthen us again. And the family… our family, is our first Galilee.
Dad: Just like when He told His disciples: “Do not be afraid, there you will see me.” Jesus calls us to be BRAVE because He is always with us!
Caretaker: Oh tito, that reminds me!
AT RISE
Caretaker retrieves the IMAGE OF THE HOLY FAMILY and gives it to Dad.
Caretaker: Pursuing holiness as a family is a journey you take together. Each one of you (points to the FAMILY SPEAKER individually) plays a role in facing the
challenges you encounter, so you can grow closer to God and one another. So, how can you be BRAVE and overcome your realities as a family?
Eldest: We can lessen screen time and be more present whenever we’re together. We have to protect our family time together!
Middle: We can serve one another and our neighbors more often.
Mom: We’ll make family time urgent and important.
Youngest: I’ll be grateful for my parents’ sacrifices!
Dad: And we’ll make God the center of our family, no matter the challenges.

STATIC SPLASH TEXT:
"Being a Christian family does not automatically guarantee the absence of trials. But through such trials, the family itself can be strengthened and, with the support of pastoral care, led to recognize its fundamental vocation in God's plan." —Synod of Bishops, 2014
Caretaker: (smiles) Exactly! And when each member strives to be GOOD AND HOLY by praying together, receiving the sacraments, and serving the community, your family will reflect Christ’s love in the world.
Dad holds up the IMAGE OF THE HOLY FAMILY visibly, for the audience to see.
Dad: Thank you for this, Kuya Jun-jun. No matter what we go through, our family will remember that Jesus is always with us.
Mom: For now, we must return to our Galilee— our own households. Kids, are you ready to go home?
Children: Yes!
Dad: Then let’s get to work!

SESSION SONG: “GOOD AND HOLY”
VERSE:
Like Jesus lived in Galilee,
We are blessed with a family
Growing every day in faith,
Jesus said: Be not afraid (good and holy)
REFRAIN
We are brave, so we love
We are brave, so we forgive
We are brave, so we rejoice
In what we are meant to be:
CHORUS
Good and holy, good and holy
As we journey with our family
God is calling you and me today
It’s time for us to be brave!
OUTRO
Good and holy, let’s be good and holy
Good and holy, it’s time for us to— (be not afraid)
Good and holy, let’s be good and holy
Good and holy, it’s time for us to be brave!
